## Project Overview
This project simulates an automated object-sorting system based on height using a Siemens S7-1200 PLC. The system detects and classifies objects according to their height and directs them to the appropriate sorting path.

## Technologies Used
- **PLC Controller:** Siemens S7-1200
- **Software:** TIA Portal (for PLC programming and simulation)
- **Simulation Environment:** Factory I/O
